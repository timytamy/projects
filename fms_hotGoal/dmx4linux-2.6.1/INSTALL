If you have trouble compiling the "dmxconsole" application in the
tools/ directory the ncurses development files are probably missing on
your installation. You can install them with something like "apt-get

If you can't compile the drivers because of missing headers try
something like "apt-get install kernel-build-2.4.27-2".

Look at the webpages http://llg.cubic.org/dmx4linux for more install
information.
