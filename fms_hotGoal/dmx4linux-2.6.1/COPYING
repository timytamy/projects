I have been unsure first what to do with the header files.
Applications using the ioctl capabilities need to use the header
file. To ensure that those applications don't fall under the
(restrictive) GPL the header file dmxioctl.h and the DMXlib and its
headers will be distributed under the LGPL. Use of it will be without
any WARRANTY.  Please inform me when you are writing software that
uses the drivers and write a small e-mail to: michael@cubic.org

If you have problems with these licenses contact us. Maybe we'll
change them in future releases if there is demand.
