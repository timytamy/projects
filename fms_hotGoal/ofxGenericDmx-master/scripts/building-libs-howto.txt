For OSX and GNU/Linux, the Makefile in the libbuilder directory should
auto-detect your OS and build the required library files; on windows,
build-libs.bat should build the required files.
If necessary, correct version numbers and possibly download URLs in the
Makefile files and after running them, copy the resultant files to their
proper locations (directory structure matches that of ofxGenericDmx).
Note that compiling libftdi1 needs cmake installed on your system.
